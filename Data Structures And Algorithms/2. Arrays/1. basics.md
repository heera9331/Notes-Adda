Array is a derived data type, which is used to stores number elements with similar data types, in contiguous memory allocations.

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable and can be used to represent lists, tables, or other data structures.

- Array is 0 indexing based data structure.
- Array is a linear data structure.
- Array provide random access to user.
- Array traversal take O(n) time complexity.

To declare an array in C, you need to specify the data type of the elements and the size of the array. The syntax for declaring an array is:

```java
// arr is variable his length is n
int arr[] = new int[n];
```

**\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\***Inserting values into Array (initialization)**\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\***

You can initialize an array by assigning values to its elements when you declare the array. The syntax for initializing an array is:

```cpp
data_type array_name[size] = {value1, value2, ..., valueN};
```

Example

```java
// first index is 0
arr[0] = 2;

// second indext is 1
arr[1] = 4;

// same as
arr[2] = 6;
arr[3] = 8;
arr[4] = 10;
```

**\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\***Accessing Array Element**\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\***

To access an element of an array, you can use the array name followed by the index of the element in square brackets. The indices of the elements start at 0 and go up to **`size - 1`**, where **`size`** is the size of the array.

For example, to access the third element of the array **`arr`** declared above, you can use the following code:

```java
// first index is 0
int n1 = arr[0];

// second indext is 1
int n2 = arr[1];

// same as
int n3 = arr[2];
int n4 = arr[3];
int n4 = arr[4];
```
