The basic idea behind this approach is to use two pointers that scan through the data structure in a specific way to solve the problem efficiently.

The basic idea behind this approach is to use two pointers that scan through the data structure in a specific way to solve the problem efficiently.

Here's an outline of how the Two Pointer Algorithm works:

1. Initialize two pointers (usually called i and j) to the start of the data structure.
2. Move the pointers through the data structure, following a specific rule. The rule depends on the problem you are trying to solve and is usually designed to narrow down the search space or check for specific conditions.
3. If the rule is met, update the solution or take some other action. Otherwise, continue moving the pointers through the data structure.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the problem is solved or there are no more elements in the data structure.
