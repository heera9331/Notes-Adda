# Unbounded Knapsack

Given a kanpsack weight w and a set of n itemms with contain 
value val[i] and weight wt[t], we need to calculate maximum
amount that could make up this quanlity excatly is different
from classical knapsack problem, 

- In this type of problem we allowed to use unlimited number 
of intances of items

**Testcases**

```
Input:
w = 100
val = {1,30}
wt = {1,50}

Output:
100
```

## Solution

```java

int knapsack(int val[], int wt[], int w) {
    
}

```
