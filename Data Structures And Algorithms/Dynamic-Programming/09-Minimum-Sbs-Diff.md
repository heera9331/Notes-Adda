# Minimum Subset Difference

Given an array of size n, the task is to divide it into two sets s1 and s2 such that the absolute difference their sum is minimum

```
input:

a[] = [2,3,5,6,8,10]

output:

difference = 2

s1 = [2,3,5,6]
s2 = [8,10]



input:

a = [1, 6, 11, 5]

output:

1

{1,11} = 12
{5,6} = 11

abs(s1,s2) => 1 (minimum)
```
