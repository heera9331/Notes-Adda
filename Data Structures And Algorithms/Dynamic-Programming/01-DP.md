# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a technique that helps us to efficiently solve a
class of problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal sub-structure
property

Dynamic Programming - Enhanced recursion

## Memoization

Memoization = recursion + dp
- top bottom-up approach

## Tabulation

Tabulation = iteration + dp
- top-down approach

7 Types of question on DP

1. Fibonacci
2. 0/1 knapsack
3. Unbounded knapsack
4. LCS (Longest Common Subsequence)
5. Kadane's Algorithm
6. Catalon Number
7. DP on Matrix


`How to identify a question on which dp is really needed to apply`

- choices
- decision
- more than one recursive calls
- Optimal values asked in question (minimum , maximum, highest, longest, lowest)
