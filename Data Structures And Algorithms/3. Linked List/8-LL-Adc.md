## Advantages

**Linked list are dynamic data structures -** that is, they can grow or shrink during the execution of a program

**Efficient memory utilization -** Memory is not pre-allocated. Memory is allocated whenever it is required. and it it deallocated(removed) when it is no longed needed.

**Insertion and Deletion are easier and efficient -** Linked lists provide flexibility in inserting a data item at a specified position and deletion of a data item from the given position.

Many complex applications can be easily carried out with linked list.

## Disadvantages

**More memory -** If the number of fields are more, then more memory space is needed.

Access to an arbitrary data item is little bit cumbersome and also time-consuming.

>**Random access not possible.**
