# Inline Function

An inline function is a function that is expanded in place at the point of its call, rather than being called by a function call. Inline functions are typically used to improve the performance of a program by reducing the overhead of calling a function.


```cpp
inline return_type function_name(parameters) {
    // function body
}

```
