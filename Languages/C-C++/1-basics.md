# Introduction
<hr>

C is a general purpose programming language used to develop system software like DBMS, Driver, Kernel, and also develop Operating System.

- C is developed by Denis Ritchie in 1972 in bell laboratories. 
- C is a system programming language many software’s have been written in c language. 
- Oracle, android core libraries, device driver, major part of web browser.
→ In 1989 c language standardized by ANSI, that language know as ANSI C.
- C is a high-level programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. 
- It was designed to be a general-purpose language that could be used for a wide range of applications, including system programming, application development, and embedded systems.
- C is known for its efficiency and flexibility, making it a popular choice for many types of software, including operating systems, databases, and applications. 
- It is also widely used in academic settings, as it is a good language for teaching the fundamentals of computer science.
-C programs are typically written in a text editor and compiled using a C compiler. 
- The compiled code can be run on a variety of platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. C is often used in conjunction with other languages, such as C++, C#, and Java, and can be used to create libraries and frameworks that can be called from other programs.

# Application of C
<hr>

C is a general-purpose programming language that is widely used in a variety of applications. Some common applications of C include:

- Operating systems: Many operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, are written in C or C++ (a programming language that is based on C). C is well-suited for operating system development due to its efficiency and ability to work closely with the hardware.
- Embedded systems: C is often used to write software for embedded systems, which are computer systems that are integrated into other devices. These systems are found in a wide range of products, including cars, appliances, and industrial equipment.
- Application development: C is a popular choice for developing desktop applications, such as text editors, word processors, and games. It is also used to write libraries and frameworks that can be called from other programming languages.
- System programming: C is often used for system programming tasks, such as writing device drivers, compilers, and interpreters. It is also used to write libraries and tools that are used by other programs.
    - Database systems: Many database systems, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, are written in C or use C libraries to perform their tasks.

# Characteristics/Advantages of C
<hr>
C is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that was developed in the 1970s. It is a popular choice for a wide range of applications, including operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems, and is known for its efficiency, portability, and flexibility. Some of the key characteristics of C include:

- Simplicity: C is a relatively simple language that is easy to learn and use, and it has a small set of keywords and a clean syntax.
- Efficiency: C is a compiled language that is designed to produce efficient code, and it is often used to write code that needs to be fast or resource-efficient.
- Portability: C is a portable language that can be used to write code that can be easily compiled and run on a wide range of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Flexibility: C is a flexible language that allows you to write code at a high or low level of abstraction, and it provides a wide range of features and libraries that can be used to build a wide range of applications.
- Standardization: C is an ISO and ANSI standard, which means that it has a well-defined syntax and semantics, and that it is widely used and supported by a variety of tools and platforms.
- Compatibility: C is widely used and is compatible with a variety of other programming languages, including C++, C#, and Java, which makes it easier to integrate with existing codebases and systems.
- Large developer community: C has a large and active developer community, which means that there is a wealth of online resources, tools, and libraries available to help you learn and work with the language.
