# Hello World

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Include the standard input/output library

int main() {  // The main function, which is the entry point of the program
    printf("Hello, World!\n");  // Print "Hello, World!" to the console
    return 0;  // Indicate that the program has completed successfully
}
```

This program consists of several parts:

- **`#include <stdio.h>`**: This line includes the standard input/output library, which provides functions for input and output operations.
- **`int main() { ... }`**: This is the main function, which is the entry point of the program. All C programs must have a main function.
- **`printf("Hello, World!\n");`**: This line uses the **`printf`** function to print the string "Hello, World!" to the console, followed by a newline character.
- **`return 0;`**: This line indicates that the program has completed successfully and returns the value **`0`** to the operating system.
