# Introduction to OOPs

A class specifies how objects are made. Think of classes as cookie cutters; objects are the cookies themselves. When you construct an object from a class, you are said to have created an instance of the class.

Encapsulation (sometimes called information hiding) is a key concept in working with objects. Formally, encapsulation is simply combining data and behavior in one package and hiding the implementation details from the users of the object. The bits of data in an object are called its instance fields, and the procedures that operate on the data are called its methods.

Object-oriented programming is a type of programming which is based on objects rather than functions and procedures. It is everything treated as object.
