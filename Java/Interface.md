# Interface

Interface called as abstract class with all abstract methods. Interfaces are useful for achieving run-time polymorphism.

It is a mechanism used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

Interface contain all method's definition partially, but abstract class may or may not.
Abstract class has extends and interfaces are implements.
• Interfaces can not be extends, it is implements.
• By default, interface contain all methods abstract and public.
• Interface can’t declare methods as static and final, but static block and final variable is also used.
• We can’t declare interface methods are protected and private.
• We can’t create an object of interface.
