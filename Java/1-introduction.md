# Introduction to Java
Java is developed by Jems Gosling in 1995.  It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.
- Java is true object-oriented programming, which is used to develop a number of applications like
- Console application
- Windows application
- Distributed application - Distributed application is a type of software application that runs on multiple computers or nodes in a network.
- Web application

## Features of Java
- WORA Principle– write once, run anywhere
- Platform independent language (machine independent). 
    Platform-independent: Java is platform-independent, which means it can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This makes it easy to write once and run anywhere.
- Memory Management
- Multi-Threading
- Secure
- Object-Oriented

## C++ vs Java
C++ and Java are two popular languages that are used for different purposes. While they share some similarities, there are also many differences between them. Here are a few key differences - 

| Feature | C++  | Java |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Memory Management | Manual memory management using pointers. Supports both stack and heap allocation. | Automatic memory management using garbage collection. Objects are allocated on the heap. |
| Object-Oriented | Supports object-oriented programming paradigm with features like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.| Fully supports object-oriented programming and enforces it as the primary programming paradigm. All types are objects except for primitive types.|
| Platform Dependency | Platform dependent | platform imdependent.| 
| Multiple Inheritance | Supports multiple inheritance, allowing a class to inherit from multiple base classes. | Does not support multiple inheritance of classes but supports multiple inheritance of interfaces through implementation. |
| Operator Overloading | C++ Support operator overloading | Does not support. |
| Pointer | C++ support pointer, which privide direct memory access | Java not support pointers. |

*Why java is not fully/true Object-Oriented programming?*

Java is not a fully object-oriented language because it supports primitive data types like int, byte, long, short, etc., which are not objects.


# JDK (Java Development Kit)

JDK is an application software. JDK is a combination of JRE and development tools.

Development tools – Development Tools are software applications that help developers to make easier the entire process of developing, testing, and deployment in Java.

Example
Javac (Java compiler to produce bytecode), jdb (Java debugger), javadoc (generate documentation)
