`Description`


Given an integer array arr of distinct integers and an integer k.

A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. arr[0] and arr[1]). In each round of the game, we compare arr[0] with arr[1], the larger integer wins and remains at position 0, and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins k consecutive rounds.

Return the integer which will win the game.

It is guaranteed that there will be a winner of the game.

`Testcases`

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: Let's see the rounds of the game:
Round |       arr       | winner | win_count
  1   | [2,1,3,5,4,6,7] | 2      | 1
  2   | [2,3,5,4,6,7,1] | 3      | 1
  3   | [3,5,4,6,7,1,2] | 5      | 1
  4   | [5,4,6,7,1,2,3] | 5      | 2
So we can see that 4 rounds will be played and 5 is the winner because it wins 2 consecutive games.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [3,2,1], k = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 will win the first 10 rounds consecutively.

## Constraints

`2 <= arr.length <= 105`

`1 <= arr[i] <= 106`

`arr contains distinct integers.`

`1 <= k <= 109`

## Approach 1



## Complexity

`Time Complexity - O()`

`Space Complexity - O()`

## Solution

```java
// brute force approach
class Solution {
    public void reverse(int[] arr, int i, int j) {

        int n = arr.length;
        int left=i;
        int right=j;
        while(left<right) {
            int t = arr[left];
            arr[left] = arr[right];
            arr[right] = t;

            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }

    public void rotateA(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        reverse(arr, 1, n-1);
        reverse(arr, 1, n-2);
    }

    public int getWinner(int[] arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int prevWin=-1;
        int cnt=0;

        while(cnt < k) {
            // i want arr[0] => max(arr[0],arr[1])
            // arr[1] => min(arr[0],arr[1])
            int mn = Math.min(arr[0],arr[1]);
            int mx = Math.max(arr[0],arr[1]);

            arr[0] = mx;
            arr[1] = mn;
            // mx is the current winner
            if(prevWin!=mx) {
                cnt=1;
                prevWin=mx;
            }
            else {
                cnt++;
            }
            rotateA(arr);
        }
        return prevWin;
    }
}
```
## Approach 2



## Complexity

`Time Complexity - O(N)`

`Space Complexity - O()`

## Solution

```java
class Solution:
    def getWinner(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        if k == 1:
            return max(arr[0], arr[1])
        if k >= len(arr):
            return max(arr)
        
        current_winner = arr[0]
        consecutive_wins = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            if current_winner > arr[i]:
                consecutive_wins += 1
            else:
                current_winner = arr[i]
                consecutive_wins = 1
            
            if consecutive_wins == k:
                return current_winner
        
        return current_winner
```
