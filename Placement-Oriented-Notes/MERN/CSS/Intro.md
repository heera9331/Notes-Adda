# CSS

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets is a language used to make websites look good by controlling how things like colours, fonts, and layout are displayed on a webpage. It was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994. Then, Håkon and another person named Bert Bos worked together to develop it further.
