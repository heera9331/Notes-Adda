Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
To include the HTTP module, use the require() method.

`var http = require('http');`

**Node.js as a Web Server**

The HTTP module can create an HTTP server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to the client.
Use the createServer() method to create an HTTP server:

```java
var http = require('http');
//create a server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
	res.write('Hello World!');
//write a response to the client
res.end(); //end the response
}).listen(8080); //the server object listens on port 8080
```
