# Graph

Graph is hierarchical (Non-Linear) data structure, and also a collection of vertices and edges
that is denoted G = (V,E)

- Graph is an abstract data type.
- A Graph is data structure is a collection of nodes that hve data and address of another node.
- A graph can be defined as G = (V,E)

## Types of Graph

1. Weighted Graph
2. Unweighted Graph
3. Directed Graph
4. Undirected Graph

## Graph Representation

1. Adjacency Matrix
2. Adjacency List

## Adjacency Matrix

- It represented by 2d array.

## Adjacency List

- It represent an array of linked list.

## Graph Traversal

1. DFS
2. BFS
