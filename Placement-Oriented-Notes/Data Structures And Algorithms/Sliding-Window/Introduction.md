# SLIDING WINDOW

It involves creating a fixed size window that moves over the input data one element at a time, and at each step, the algorithm updates its state based on the elements in the current window.

A sliding window is a technique used to process a portion of an array, string, or other data structure by iterating over it in a fixed-size window or sub-array. 

The window slides through the data structure from left to right, one element at a time, and at each position, a specified operation is performed on the current window. 

The size of the window and the operation to be performed on each window can vary depending on the problem at hand.

The sliding window technique is particularly useful for solving problems that involve finding a substring or subarray of fixed size with certain properties.
