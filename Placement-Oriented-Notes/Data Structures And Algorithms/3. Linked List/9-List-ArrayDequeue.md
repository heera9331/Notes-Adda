A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a reference to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are dynamic data structures, which means that they can grow or shrink in size during the execution of a program.

An ArrayDeque is a special type of array-based data structure that is implemented as a resizable array and allows for fast insertion and removal of elements at both ends of the list. ArrayDeques are also known as "double-ended queues" because they support efficient insertion and removal of elements at both the front and the back of the queue.

There are a few key differences between linked lists and ArrayDeques in Java:

1. Performance: ArrayDeques are generally faster than linked lists for most operations, such as inserting and removing elements at the front and back of the list. However, linked lists may be faster for inserting and removing elements in the middle of the list.
2. Memory usage: Linked lists use more memory than ArrayDeques because each node in a linked list stores a reference to the next node in addition to the element itself. ArrayDeques, on the other hand, store only the elements in the array.
3. Iteration: Linked lists can be iterated using an iterator or by following the links between the nodes. ArrayDeques can be iterated using an iterator or by accessing the elements directly in the array using an index.
4. Thread safety: Linked lists are not thread-safe, which means that they are not designed to be used concurrently by multiple threads. ArrayDeques, on the other hand, are thread-safe and can be used concurrently by multiple threads.

In general, ArrayDeques are a good choice when you need a fast and efficient data structure for inserting and removing elements at both ends of the list, while linked lists are a good choice when you need a data structure that can grow and shrink dynamically and allows for inserting and removing elements in the middle of the list.
