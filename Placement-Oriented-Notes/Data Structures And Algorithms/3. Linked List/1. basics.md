Linked list is linear data structure that hold data in individual objects called nodes.

- A linked list is linear data structure in which elements are linked using pointers. It consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and another reference(link) to the next node in the list.
- Linked is a Abstract Data Type (ADT)

## Types of Linked List

- Singly linked list
- [Doubly linked list] 
- Circular linked list
- Circular doubly linked list

Linked lists are commonly used in computer science applications, such as implementing hash tables, representing sparse matrices, and implementing graphs and adjacency lists. 

They are also used in many programming languages to implement dynamic data structures, such as lists and queues.

**Applications of linked list**


| Linked List | Array |
| --- | --- |
| A linked list is a collection of elements, where each element (or node) contains a reference to the next element in the list. | An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations, where each element can be accessed directly using its index |
| Size should be grow dynamically. | Size is static. |
| Memory allocate dynamically | Require contiguous memory allocation |
| Random access is not possible. | Random access is possible through indexing. |
| Accessing of elements take linear time. O(N) | Accessing of element take constant time. O(1) |
| Efficient use of memory. | Not efficient use of memory. |
