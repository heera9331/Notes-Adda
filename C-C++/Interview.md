**What are pointers in C and how are they used? Can you provide an example of code where pointers are used effectively in a fullstack development scenario?**

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. It allows you to indirectly manipulate data by referencing the memory location where the data is stored.

Example in a Fullstack Development Scenario:
Let's consider a scenario where you are working on a web application, and you need to manipulate data related to users and their information.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Structure to represent a user
struct User {
    int id;
    char username[20];
    char email[50];
};

// Function to update user information using pointers
void updateUser(struct User *userPtr, const char *newUsername, const char *newEmail) {
    // Check for NULL pointer to avoid segmentation faults
    if (userPtr != NULL) {
        // Updating user information through pointers
        snprintf(userPtr->username, sizeof(userPtr->username), "%s", newUsername);
        snprintf(userPtr->email, sizeof(userPtr->email), "%s", newEmail);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Creating a user and obtaining its address through a pointer
    struct User user1 = {1, "john_doe", "john@example.com"};
    struct User *userPtr = &user1;

    // Displaying user information before the update
    printf("User ID: %d\nUsername: %s\nEmail: %s\n", userPtr->id, userPtr->username, userPtr->email);

    // Updating user information using the updateUser function
    updateUser(userPtr, "new_john_doe", "new_john@example.com");

    // Displaying user information after the update
    printf("\nUser information after update:\n");
    printf("User ID: %d\nUsername: %s\nEmail: %s\n", userPtr->id, userPtr->username, userPtr->email);

    return 0;
}


```

**Can you tell me about a project where you utilized your C knowledge in the fullstack domain? How did you use C to enhance the functionality or performance of the project?**

Yes I have used the knowledge of c programming to in my recent project (college counselling system), where I used my knowledge in dbms how to store the data and also consider the how much memory required
to store the particular type of data.

C programming teach me that how memory is used by software and how to use efficient
memory by taking required data type for specific use.
