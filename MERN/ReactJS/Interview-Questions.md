# REACTJS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
----

`What is React.js?
`

React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's maintained by Facebook and a community of developers.

`What is JSX in React?`

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe the structure of UI components. It looks similar to HTML but gets transpiled into JavaScript.

`What are components in React?`

Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of the user interface that can be composed to build complex UIs.

`What is the difference between functional components and class components in React?`

Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that accept props and return JSX. Class components are JavaScript classes that extend React.Component and have a render method.

`What is the purpose of props in React?`

Props (short for properties) are used for passing data from parent components to child components. They are read-only and help make components reusable.

`What is state in React?`

State is an object that represents the data a component needs to render. Unlike props, state is mutable and is used for managing component-specific data.


`What is the difference between state and props?`

State is mutable and managed by the component itself, while props are read-only and passed from a parent component.

`What is a React event handler?`

A React event handler is a function that is called when an event (e.g., a button click) occurs in a React component. Event handlers are typically defined in the component.

`What is the virtual DOM in React?`

The virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM. React uses it to optimize updates and improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the real DOM.

`Explain the component lifecycle methods in React.`

Components in React have lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount that allow you to perform actions at various stages of a component's existence.

`What is React Router?`

React Router is a popular library for handling routing and navigation in React applications. It allows you to define routes and navigate between different parts of your app.

`What is the purpose of keys in React lists?`

Keys are used to uniquely identify elements in a list of components. 
They help React efficiently update and re-render lists.

`Explain the concept of conditional rendering in React.`

Conditional rendering involves displaying different components or content based on specific conditions or user interactions. It's typically done using if statements or conditional operators in JSX.

`What is React Hooks?`

React Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. The most commonly used hooks are useState and useEffect.

`What are the advantages of using React for building user interfaces?`

React provides a component-based architecture for building reusable UI elements, offers a virtual DOM for performance optimization, and has a large and active community.

`Can you explain the difference between useState and useEffect in React?`

`Candidate:` "Certainly! useState and useEffect are two fundamental React Hooks that serve distinct roles in a React component.

`useState` is used for managing and updating the state of a component. It allows us to declare and initialize a state variable, and it returns an array with the current state value and a function to update that state. This is particularly useful for handling component-specific data like form input values, counters, and toggles. For example:

On the other hand, `useEffect` is designed for handling side effects within a React component. Side effects can include asynchronous operations like data fetching, DOM manipulation, and responding to state or prop changes.

In summary, `useState` is all about managing and updating the local state of a component, while `useEffect` is focused on handling side effects and executing actions that need to occur after the component has rendered.
