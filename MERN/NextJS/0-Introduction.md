# NextJS

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user `interfaces`, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

## Main Features of NextJS

> Routing - A file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.

> Rendering - Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components.

> Data Fetching - Simplified data fetching with async/await in Server Components, and an extended fetch API for request memoization, data caching and revalidation.

> Styling - Support for your preferred styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS

> Optimizations - Image, Fonts, and Script Optimizations to improve your application's Core Web Vitals and User Experience.

> Typescript - Improved support for TypeScript, with better type checking and more efficient compilation, as well as custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker.

## App Router vs Pages Router

Next.js has two different routers: the App Router and the Pages Router.

> The App Router is a newer router that allows you to use React's latest features, such as Server Components and Streaming.
> The Pages Router is the original Next.js router, which allowed you to build server-rendered React applications and continues to be supported for older Next.js applications.
