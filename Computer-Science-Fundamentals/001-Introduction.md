Debugging - The process of finding and removing errors or bugs in your code.

Challenges to S/W developers

→ Naming

→ Legacy code - Code that you’re afraid to change.

→ Providing estimates

How many total hours of coding will they have?

What type of research is needed beforehand?

Will it be easy or difficult to write tests for this feature?

Do they need to provide documentation?

## Types of Software

**System Software**

Provide core functions such as operating systems or hardware management.

**Application Software**

complete user task

**Programming Software**

Debugging, writing code, developing.

## Software Development Life Cycle

1. Requirements Gathering
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Coding
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

## Tools used for S/W Development

Whiteboards

Online collaboration software.

Paper and Pencil

## Project Management Software

Define each task.

Assign in to the appropriate person.

Monitor the time it takes.

Monitor company budget.

### ******\*\*******S/W Deployment******\*\*******

Delivering s/w to the intended users

### **Web Application S/W Deployment**

Code is tested for bugs

Code is packaged into existing product

New executable is produced

Executable is copied to the internet.

### Mobile **Application S/W Deployment**

Code is packaged into existing product

New executable is produced

New executable is given to the tester

Tester manually checks for bugs

Executable is copied to the app store

### Version Control

Version control is practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.

**Version Control System**

Tools that help software teams manage code changes.

→ History of changes

→ Simultaneous work

→ Troubleshooting

************\*\*\*\*************Repository Hosting Services************\*\*\*\*************

Third party web applications that wrap and enhance a version control system.

→ Bitbucket same as GitHub.

### Library

Code that someone else has written and verified.

Example -

Ktor - Ktor is Kotlin programming language library that help as to make network requests

Numpy - Numpy is a python, machine learning library.

### Framework

Serves as the blueprint for how your s/w project should be configured and developed

### IDE

An application that provides special tools for programmers to write, debug, and compile code.

Example

VS Code is a lightweight IDE Designed for JavaScript & TypeScript

IntelliJ IDEA - for java programming

### Programming Language

A way of providing instructions to a computer written in text and based on a set of rules.

**Component of programming language**

Syntax(Rules)

Semantics (Meaning)

### Source Code

Human-readable computer instructions written by programmers

### Variable

Space in computer memory where we can put data that we want to use as a reference for later.

### Compiling

one way that human-readable code is converted into machine code
